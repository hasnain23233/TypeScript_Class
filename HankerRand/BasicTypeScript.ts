// Question1 = Data Types - Use multiple data types for variables. One can ask the compiler to ignore the type to take advantage of dynamic types. TS has support for ‘any’ type, primitive data types like number, boolean, string, void, null, undefined, enum.

let StringData: string | number = 345
console.log(StringData)

let useAny: any = 934
console.log(useAny)
